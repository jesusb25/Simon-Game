## Description

I built the Simon game using simple buttons, event handlers, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to further understand game logic in programming and interactive web development.

Looking ahead, I would like to add different game styles with new logic like extra next steps per level or a chaos mode.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.

- npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```
  Best for Node Version 18

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/jesusb25/Simon-Game.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Start local server
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
   This will still make calls to external API but the server functions can be found in server.js

### Dependencies

Requires Node version 18
